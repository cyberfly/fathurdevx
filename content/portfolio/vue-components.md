# Vue + Laravel Components Library

## Background

When I was working at Nazrol Tech Sdn Bhd (Software House) and involved in multiple projects, I noticed there were a lot of repetitive Front End components across projects.

Not only was it repetitive, but each project also had a different way to build the feature, so it consumed time and money to maintain each variation, even though they all did the same thing.

## Solution

So for the new project that I was assigned as the Lead Developer, I built this collection of Vue components to help speed up Front End development and eliminate repetitive tasks.

You can watch the implementation here.

## Result

The implementation was a success. We have used the components library for multiple projects and managed to save a lot of time and money. I just need to maintain the library and improve it from time to time. It's battle-hardened.
