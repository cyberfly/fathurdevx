# Plum - Project Management Tools

## Background

Our team hates Jira and want to replace with something else. We then build Plum and end up replacing Jira.

This is my first project at LaLoka Labs and I focused on building the front end using VueJs and TailwindCSS.

I also actively involve in the UX parts and work closely with our designer.

I also propose multiple useful features and successfully implemented into the project.

## Features

- Todoist inside task
- Global discussion stream
- Custom Markdown Editor
- Mention

## Stack

- VueJS
- TailwindCSS
- Django with Django Rest Framework
